                <h3>Bicep curl</h3>
            </div>
            <p>A bicep curl usually starts with the arm in a fully extended position, holding a weight with a
                supinated (palms facing up) grip. A full repetition consists of bending or "curling" the elbow until
                it is fully flexed, then slowly lowering the weight to the starting position. The torso should
                remain upright instead of swinging back and forth, as doing so transfers the load away from the
                biceps and onto other muscles, reducing the effectiveness of the exercise. The elbows are also
                usually kept stationary at the side of the torso, as allowing the elbows to move in front of the
                weight's center of gravity removes tension on the biceps before full contraction is achieved</p>

                <h3>Hammer curl</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Hammer curls work on the biceps and forearm muscles. Nevertheless, it emphasizes different areas of the
                arm when compared to a traditional bicep curls. For example, hammer curls provide an increased workout
                for the forearm muscles.</p>

                <h3>Wide Bicep curl</h3>
            </div>
            <p>While the narrow grip is great for focusing on the long head for better peak development, the standard
                shoulder-width grip hits both heads and the wide grip not only hits the short head best, but also allows
                you to go a bit heavier for placing greater overload on the biceps.</p>
